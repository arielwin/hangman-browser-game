# Automotive Hangman

## This is my browser-based game of hangman!
This game of hangman choses from a wordbank related to cars and car parts. (That is my childhood passion.) I chose this game because when I visualized coding this game I felt that I could see and understnad all of the pieces. Now that it is complete, I am excited to roll what I have learned into more complex projects.

## Getting Started:

[Click here to play my game!](https://arielwin.github.io/hangman-browser-game/) 

Instructions: 
 - Simply click on the keyboard to guess letters of the secret word. 
 - Be careful: you only have as many guess as the stickman has body parts! 
 - Win or lose, you can reset the game at any point using the play again button at the bottom.

## Tech I Used:

 - HTML
 - Javascript
 - CSS

## Next Steps:

The next steps for this project are pretty simply: I would like to return to this project in the future and see how much of it I can simplify. I believe my code at this point, while it functions well, may be inefficient.
